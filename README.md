# Advaced-keylogger-reverse-shell-ransomware.-spyware.
This program is designed to exploit and execute a range of malicious actions on a system. The program is managed and controlled through the messaging app, Telegram, using a secure connection. This allows an attacker to remotely send data, execute commands, collect data, encrypt data, and collect passwords from the system. All of this information is then sent to the attacker's Telegram account, providing them with a convenient and secure way to monitor and control the program.

# The program is capable of performing the following actions:

- Data exfiltration, in which sensitive data is extracted from the compromised system and sent to a remote location
- Remote access trojan (RAT), which allows for remote control of the system
- Taking pictures and videos using the system's camera
- Key logging, in which a key logger is installed on the system to record all keyboard input, including passwords and other sensitive information
- Ransomware, which locks down the system and demands payment for its release
- Recording the target, capturing audio and video from the system's microphone and camera

In addition, the program is able to evade detection by endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems.
